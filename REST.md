# REST, or REpresentational State Transfer APIs

**Key characteristics**

1. **Statelessness:** Server retains no information about previous HTTP request.
2. **Caching capabilities:** Clients should be able to cache responses to enhance performance.
3. **Simplicity and loose coupling**
4. **Resource identifiability:** Each API endpoint is a distinct resource and it enables us to secure them separately
5. **Interface as a contract:** The REST API layer serves as an exchange contract or an abstraction. 

**HTTP methods**

**HTTP status codes and headers:** HTTP status codes inform clients about the success or failure of their requests. HTTP headers transmit additional information and describe clientsâ€™ options and capabilities. Both are essential components of HTTP communication.
**Versioning:** Managing changes in APIs without disrupting existing clients is a significant challenge. Different strategies for API versioning can help address this issue, but each comes with its own trade-offs.
**Data Transfer Object (DTO):** DTOs package data into a format that can provide many benefits, including reducing the number of HTTP calls, improving encapsulation, and enhancing performance when sending data over the network.
**API contracts:** Clear and robust API contracts ensure API stability. They serve as a blueprint for interaction between an API and its consumers, outlining available endpoints, supported HTTP methods, expected request formats, and potential response structures.
**Practical application:** Understanding these concepts is not only theoretically important but also practically helpful in building and working with REST APIs using ASP.NET Core or any other similar technology.
